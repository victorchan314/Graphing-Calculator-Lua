An optional graphing calculator project I completed for AP Calculus BC. The day before the project was due, my teacher more than doubled the benefits of doing the project, so that night, I worked straight from 9:00pm to 3:00am in order to get the project ready. The calculator takes in inputs for the window zoom and returns the function, first and second derivatives, and shows relative maxima and minima, points of inflection, and concavity.
